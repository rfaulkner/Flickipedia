    <p>
        Welcome.  This is a tool that blends the photographic beauty of Flickr with the Encyclopedic richness of Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
        To see how it works type in a topic below and hit "submit".  The first time you ask, it may take some time, but after that the response
        should be a bit more timely.  Once you see your article weigh on which photos you think are right.  This tool is still very young
        so there may be some kinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy Viewing!
